//3rd part are minor fixes (optional)
//npmjs.com 

//2nd part 19 is the recommended bug fix, security fix

//1st part is the major release - Major / Breaking update .. (donot update)

so what does the caret symbol mean??
^Compatible with version...

express = ^4.19.2
4th version, 19th bugfix release, and 2nd minor fix release..

so caret symbol lets you install npm versions less than the (n+1.0.0) if your current version is (n.x.y) 
^- install all minor fixes and bug fix releases... but don't for the major release...


~ - install only the minor fixess...
~4.18.2 (4.18.x) x is the only possible variable here...
